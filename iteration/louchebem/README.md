- **constraint**: any one-letter words like "a" should not be translated
- **constraint**: for words beginning with consonants ("chat", "trou"), you'll have to take the first *consonant group* (all the letters before the first vowel) and put it at the end, add an `l` to the start of the word and add a suffix at the end ("chat" should give "latchem", or "latchoc")
- **constraint**: words beginning with a vowel are not changed but you should still add an `l` to the start of the word and a suffix at the end ("atout" should give "latoutoc" or  "latoutic")
- **constraint**: the random suffix should be one of these: `["em", "é", "ji", "oc", "ic", "uche", "ès"]`
