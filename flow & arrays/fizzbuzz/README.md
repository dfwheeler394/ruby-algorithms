Write a method `fizz_buzz` which takes a `number` as an argument, and
return an array of `number` elements from 1 to `number`, but replaces some
of them according to these rules:

- If the number is divisible by `3`, then replace it by `'Fizz'`
- If the number is divisible by `5`, then replace it by `'Buzz'`
- If the number is divisible by both `3` and `5`, then replace it by `'FizzBuzz'`
